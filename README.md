# WildDex

### About
WildDex is an app that allows you to view animal species from around the world. You can find animals near you, or select a country to view animals that live abroad. The app also allows you to sort the animals in alphabetical order of the scientific names, using either heap sort or quick sort.

### Usage
To use the app, install Xcode or Swift Playgrounds on your MacBook or iPad. Then download the zip file and open it in either app. If you use a MacBook, you can either pair your MacBook with your phone or run the app on a simulator. Press the run button at the top to run the app.
